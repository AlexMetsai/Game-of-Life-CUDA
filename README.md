# Game-of-Life-CUDA
A CUDA implementation of Conway's "Game of Life" that I did a while ago. 

******************************
     Compile Instructions 
******************************
Install CUDA.  
Compile: nvcc filename.cu  
Run the a.out file and the number of generations and table size will be asked as input.  
A file containing the binary world table, "tableSIZExSIZE.bin" must exist within the same directory (even with zeroes).
