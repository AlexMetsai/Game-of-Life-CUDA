# Game-of-Life-CUDA
A CUDA implementation of Conway's "Game of Life" that I did a while ago. 

******************************
 Compile and Run Instructions 
******************************
Install CUDA.  

Compile: 'nvcc filename.cu'
Run the a.out file.   The number of generations to be played and the world table size will be asked as input by the program.  
A file containing the binary world table, "tableSIZExSIZE.bin" must exist within the same directory (even with zeroes).
